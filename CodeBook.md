##CodeBook for Tidy Project - Samsung Fitness Experiment##

###Overview###
An experiment was carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities:
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


###Input Data###

The raw input data for this project was gathered in an experiment of people exercising while wearing Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. Accelerometer and gyroscope data was collected from a variety of signals.  The input data will be downloaded and installed by the run_analysis.R script if needed, but can be reviewed at the links below:

CodeBook: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This data included both the raw sampled data (folder ../Inertial Signals) and Features. This project uses the features data, not the Inertial Signals.

There are several types of input files:

x: rows of feature signal measurements

y: activity labels corresponding to each row of X. 

subject: a number identifying the person on which each row of X was measured. The order of this file is in sync with the x and y files. This is important!  

feature: To determine which features correspond to which measurements, match the list of features in the file:
features.txt 
The order of this file is in sync with the x and y files. This is important!

activity: Activity labels ids are converted to descriptive names in file:
activity_labels.txt

###Input Files###

The Y, S and X data are loaded from each of the training and test dataset.
All of these files are fixed format text files.

###Data Manipuations###

The Features are processed first to pull out the std and mean columns using the grep command.  The features file is read, and the Mean and Standard Deviation variables are identified, by looking for fields ending 
in -std() or -mean().  This choice was made after carefully reviewing the contents of the feature dataset. The spec was a bit ambiguous about the 
definition of "mean" and "std", so it was safer to err on the side of selecting a few extra elements. The phrase "measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement" allowed for the exclusion of fields with MEAN or STD embedded in the name, not as a suffix (e.g fBodyAccMag-**mean**Freq()).

The Training X&Y data is combined. Subject is merged in.
The Test X&Y data is combined. Subject is merged in.
The Train and Test data is combined into a single data.table

The activity descriptions are joined to the activity label data (y) and joined to the combined Train.Test data.table.

###Output Files###
The Activity ID is removed as it is no longer needed.  The final data.table is called **tidy.Train.Test.Output**.
This result is output as a text file "tidy_Train_Test_Output.txt".

The data is further subsetted to only include the activity, subject, and then the mean() function is applied. The data.table is called **tidy.Summary**

This tidy dataset is output as a text file "tidy_summary.txt".

###Code Book###

1. Activity - Character - describes the exercise performed by the subject
	- WALKING
	- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	- SITTING
	- STANDING
	- LAYING
      
2. Subject_ID - sequence number values 1-30 identifying the subject (person) who performed the exercise.

3. Time_Body_Acc_std_X : Freq_Body_Body_Gyro_Jerk_Mag_mean_Freq
This is an array of 79 variables collected from Samsung phones using embedded accelerometer and gyroscopes. All the measurements are similar  in nature  They describe the X, Y and Z axis of a variety of features.  For example, the acceleration signal is from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.  The same description applies for the Y and Z axis.  Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. Each feature vector is a row on the text file, so every row shows all 79 measurements.
